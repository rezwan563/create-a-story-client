* You can find popular classes on our homepage
* You can go to **Classses** page to find all our classes
* You can also browse classes based on our instructors on **Instructors** page

Now, the remaining parts of the main requirements are related to the admins, students and instructors panels and their specific authorities. This is the tricky part. I am not sure how much I can get done in these parts. I will watch the module to clear my doubts. Let's hope for the best!
